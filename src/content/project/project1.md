In collaboration with Linus Stuhlmann, I recently completed a project to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for biomedical question-answering. Our project aimed to tackle the challenges of reproducibility and scalability in this field, addressing how to leverage large datasets, like PubMed, to improve accuracy and efficiency in biomedical information retrieval.

### Project Overview

Our RAG system is specifically designed for the biomedical domain, integrating advanced retrieval techniques with language models. We used a subset of the PubMed corpus, incorporating tools like Elasticsearch and FAISS to manage and retrieve vast amounts of data efficiently. The system leverages multiple retrieval methods, including BM25 and MedCPT, to optimize performance in terms of recall and precision. 

### Why a RAG System for Biomedical QA?

Biomedical data is constantly evolving, and question-answering systems in this domain need to provide accurate, up-to-date information. Traditional language models often struggle with verifiability and can produce inaccurate responses (hallucinations), which can be particularly harmful in healthcare settings. By integrating retrieval methods directly into the generation process, our system grounds the answers in authoritative sources, enhancing both accuracy and trustworthiness.

### Key Components and Methodology

1. **Database Systems:** We evaluated several database systems, including MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and FAISS, to identify the best fit for our requirements. Elasticsearch provided efficient full-text search, while FAISS excelled at semantic vector searches, balancing speed and accuracy.

2. **Retrieval Methods:** To improve the relevance of the retrieved information, we compared multiple retrieval methods, such as BM25, BioBERT, and MedCPT. Our hybrid method, combining BM25 and MedCPT, showed the highest recall and precision, making it ideal for comprehensive biomedical information retrieval.

3. **System Architecture:** The architecture comprises Docker containers for managing Elasticsearch and FAISS, ensuring scalability and real-time processing. This structure supports efficient query handling and response generation, all while maintaining data integrity and high availability.

### Challenges and Future Directions

While our system shows promise, there are areas for improvement. For instance, we only used a 10% subset of PubMed due to computational constraints, limiting the generalizability of our findings. Future work will involve scaling the system for larger datasets, incorporating patient-specific information for more personalized responses, and exploring open-source language models to enhance reproducibility.

In conclusion, this project offers a scalable approach to biomedical question-answering. Collaborating with Linus brought diverse insights into the development process, allowing us to address both technical and methodological challenges effectively. We look forward to future work that builds upon these findings, making biomedical RAG systems more accessible and reliable for researchers and healthcare professionals alike.
