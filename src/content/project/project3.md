As part of our project thesis at ZHAW, we are working  with the High Energy Physics group at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Freja Rasmussen and I are working on optimizing primary vertex (PV) reconstruction at the CMS experiment at CERN. This project is still a work in progress, aimed at improving the efficiency of PV reconstruction to handle the increasing number of events anticipated in the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) phase.

### Project Overview

The goal of our research is to reduce computation time for reconstructing primary vertices from proton-proton collision data while maintaining or improving current reconstruction accuracy. With the upcoming HL-LHC upgrade, the CMS detector will need to process up to five times more pile-up (PU) events per collision, creating a significant challenge for existing algorithms. By refining the current methods, we hope to develop a solution that is scalable and robust enough to meet these future demands.



### Why Vertex Reconstruction Matters

Primary vertex reconstruction is crucial for accurately interpreting collision data, as it enables the separation of signal events from pile-up events. Faster PV reconstruction will enhance the CMS detector's ability to process high volumes of data, making it more efficient for real-time analysis during the HL-LHC phase.
