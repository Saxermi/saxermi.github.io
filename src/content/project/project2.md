In collaboration with Linus Stuhlmann, I conducted a study evaluating the effectiveness of different transformer layers in three advanced speech encoder models—Wav2Vec 2.0, XLS-R, and Whisper—when applied to speaker identification tasks. Our goal was to understand how layer-wise representations contribute to capturing speaker-specific features and determine optimal configurations for these models.

### Project Overview

Speaker identification is essential in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and audio processing applications. For this project, we focused on three prominent models, analyzing their layer-wise performance to pinpoint which transformer layers most effectively encode speaker-specific information. We used advanced evaluation techniques, such as Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA), k-means clustering, and t-SNE visualizations, to assess layer contributions in each model.

### Why Evaluate Transformer Layers?

Each model's transformer layers extract features differently, influencing their ability to capture speaker characteristics. By fine-tuning and analyzing each model layer-by-layer, we aim to identify patterns and optimal configurations that maximize performance for speaker identification tasks. Our findings can help streamline the development of efficient and accurate speaker recognition systems.

### Key Components and Methodology

1. **Encoder Models:** We evaluated three models: Wav2Vec 2.0, XLS-R, and Whisper. Each model processes audio inputs differently, influencing how they capture speaker-specific information.

2. **Evaluation Techniques:** 
   - **SVCCA:** We used this technique to measure linear correlations between hidden states and speaker labels, helping us pinpoint layers that best capture speaker features.
   - **Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction:** We applied k-means clustering and t-SNE to visualize and assess the distinctiveness of speaker embeddings at different layers.
   - **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Using Optuna, we determined the optimal number of layers for each model to enhance accuracy and reduce computational resources.

3. **Experimental Data:** Our data comprised audio samples from the Mozilla Common Voice dataset, covering various languages and balanced in terms of gender. This diverse dataset allowed us to evaluate model performance across multiple linguistic and demographic groups.

### Results and Insights

Our analysis revealed that:
- Wav2Vec 2.0 and XLS-R capture speaker-specific features effectively in early layers, while Whisper's effectiveness increases in deeper layers.
- The optimal layer configurations are 7 layers for Wav2Vec 2.0, 3 layers for XLS-R, and 16 layers for Whisper.
- Fine-tuning improves stability and clustering performance, with distinct improvements in layer-wise performance metrics.

### Challenges and Future Directions

The study highlights the importance of choosing the right layers for specific tasks, especially in computationally intensive applications like speaker identification. However, we encountered limitations, such as the inability to fully explore non-linear relationships with our chosen analysis methods. Future work will involve testing on larger datasets and exploring the effects of non-linear transformations.

In conclusion, this project sheds light on the importance of layer-wise analysis in transformer-based speech models. Working with Linus enabled us to explore various methodological approaches, and we look forward to expanding this research to cover more diverse datasets and additional model architectures in the future.
